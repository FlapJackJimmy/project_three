# project_three

* Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program needs to be able to count the number of specific iterations found in the text file, determine the frequency of every item as a list, determine the frequency of every item as a histogram, an exit program option, and create a DAT file upon exiting the program. 

* What did you do particularly well?
This progam met the criteria for the project. Something I was particularly happy with was the histogram and getting it to line up properly in a row.

* Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I'm not sure where I could improve the code. i could try to make the coments more legible perhaps. I could try to clean the code a little more.
I did what I could to make the as streamlined and efficient as possible.

* Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Most of this code was somewhat difficult. It took most of what I learned from this course to pull off this code, looking up things on StackOverflow really assisted in getting the code as whittled down as it is. However, I spent a good deal of time learning how to make the histogram work properly. By using \r carriage return I was able to \t out twice and make a clean chart. 

* What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the time I spent managing the in-line comments and debugging this code taight me a ton and I think this will carry me pretty far on future works. 

* How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
 I spent a lot of time going over this code to achieve these three principles. I tried to code as little as possible, place in-line comments, and make the code generic in its processing so that any .txt can be read and translated and graphed.
